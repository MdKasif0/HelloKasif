*   **Firebase:** Used for backend services (if applicable, specify which services like Firestore, Authentication, etc.).
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
*   **TypeScript:** For static typing and improved code quality.
*   **Vibe Coding & Firebase Studio:** (Mention how these were used, e.g., "Initial project setup and theming by Vibe Coding using Firebase Studio.")
