    problem: "Creating a seamless web app that allows users to generate high-quality images using text prompts, leveraging AI models while ensuring smooth user experience.",
    myRole: "I independently handled the entire development of the project â€” from UI/UX design to backend integration with Hugging Face APIs. I also iteratively improved the product based on testing and feedback.",
    process: "I began by outlining the key features of the app, starting with a minimal interface to generate images from text input. Over time, I added more advanced features, enhanced styling, and improved loading feedback. Assistance from ChatGPT and Gemini helped troubleshoot issues and refine functionality.",
    solution: "An AI-powered web app that lets users generate images using text prompts through Hugging Face APIs. The app features a clean UI, responsive design, and dynamic loading states for better user experience.",
    result: "The final product is a fully functional and visually appealing AI image generator. It performs reliably and has been positively received for its simplicity and effectiveness.",
